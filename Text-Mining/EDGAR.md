EDGAR - Reading Information Tables in Text Format

So far, we have collected CIKs for each of the Mutual Funds, then looked up the links of all the 13F HRs and the Information Tables, and identified them either text tables or xml tables. In class, we  obtained the information from the xml tables.  In this assignment we will obtain information from the text file.  These are not as nicely structured as the xml output.   In a csv (HW_Mutual_Fund_Info_Table_Link.csv) you will find a few of these links.  Your goal for this part of the homework is to obtain the link to the text files from the attached file  (HW_Mutual_Fund_Info_Table_Link.csv).  Then you will write a code that will go to the links of all the linked text files, and extract some columns.  Do not use Beutiful Soup for this assignment.
