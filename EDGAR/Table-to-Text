EDGAR - Reading Information Tables in Text Format:

Obtain information from the text file.  These are not as nicely structured as the xml output.   In a csv (HW_Mutual_Fund_Info_Table_Link.csv) you will find a few of these links.  Your goal for this part of the homework is to obtain the link to the text files from the attached file  (HW_Mutual_Fund_Info_Table_Link.csv).  Then you will write a code that will go to the links of all the linked text files, and extract some columns.  Do not use Beutiful Soup for this assignment.
