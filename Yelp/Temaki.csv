temaki,Melanie C.,"I'm writing this review as I finish the last bite of my Hamachi Golden-ratio Tare. \n\nThe hand rolls here are incredible. So fresh tasting. I got the negi yellowtail, Hamachi golden ratio tare (as stated above), the uni, and the wagyu shabu. I have to say the uni was so clean and wasn't extremely briney. The wagyu also melted in your mouth. I highly recommend you eat the rolls immediately as they are handed to you, or you won't be able enjoy the full experience of the roll. They also toast the nori so that adds another incredible element to the roll. I can really appreciate the simplicity of the hand rolls as it allows the fish or meat being served to really shine. I have been searching for a truly authentic Japanese sushi experience since we moved here in January and I've finally found it! I can't stand those rolls drowning in sauce and inauthentic sushi ingredients. Thank you all for an amazing dining experience! I definitely will be back!"
,Lili T.,"J WATA!!! I've never been to a restaurant and experienced this type of dining experience before and I really enjoyed it! I can't lie - I took advantage of the BOGO Grand Opening deal!\n\nI went once with my friend's deal and we got the Go which included 5 handrolls per person - Maine Lobster, Spicy Tuna, Negi Salmon, Scallops, and Blue Crab. It was so delicious, I went again the next day with my little brother! I love that each handroll is made right in front of us and the seaweed is roasted over the open flame. They tell us to be sure to try and eat it quickly so that we can experience the crunch of the nori - YUM is all I can say! Having that crunch of the nori is the added bonus to a well crafted roll! \n\nRanking the rolls from my most favorite to least favorite: Maine Lobster, Negi Salmon, Spicy Tuna and Blue Crab tied, and scallops. I don't absolutely LOVE the scallops with mayo which is why I ranked it as my least favorite. All rolls are crafted with hot rice and rolled like a burrito style rather than a cone. \n\nOur service was top notch and I'm excited to come back here when I'm back in town - however, it is kind of pricey without the deal!"
,Tiffanie L.,"Pretty comparable to Kazu Nori in LA!\n\nI ordered the Shi (4) and got the Blue Crab, Negi Yellowtail, Spicy Salmon and Bay Scallop. I really enjoyed every hand roll on this set menu. I liked the fact that they added green onion to the yellowtail so it gave the roll a nice crunch. The Blue Crab and Bay Scallop had the perfect amount of mayo and it wasn't overly creamy! \n\nPricing: A little over $16 for 4\nParking: private lot + street parking"
,Jimmy D.,3.5 Stars\n\nCool concept as you can easily drop in for a handroll or few.  Rolls came out fairly quick after ordering and they only make one at a time for you so that it is eaten fresh.\n\nThe rice is fairly warm and the nori was lightly toasted for a slight crisp on the first few bites.  The raw seafood was fresh and prepared well.  I got the \
,Desmond F.,"4.5 stars\n\nA premium hand roll experience, everything is made fresh and just before you eat it. One can get rolls a la carte or there are there are set menus San (3) Shi (4) and Go (5) and if you're not picky is the way to go to get the price breaks. We ordered two Go sets and a few a la cart to try everything we wanted. In the end we tried the Maine Lobster, Bay Scallop, Spicy toro, Negi Salmon, Blue Crab, Shabu Wagyu Beef and Unagi.\n\nEverything was very good, what stood out to me was the smoky crunchiness of the nori. It starts out lovingly flame kissed and then only when it is warmed and toasted is it used.  Most places the nori is a mass produced after thought, there just for the structural integrity of the roll or handroll. But here it is your introduction, the beautiful edible wrapping paper of a tasty gift to your palate. \n\nOf the 7 rolls I had the opportunity to try the blue crab was the one that stood out to me. After the first bite the flavor hit me as a reminder of how a premium Japanese taste experience is really just a moment of simple yet eye opening tranquility. It was just a fleeting few bites but so awakening. \n\nJ/Wata is not for all, the wait will invariably be long because of the limited seating (I counted about 20) so a large party will not do well here. It is also located in the my least favorite part of Convoy, the Parking lot from hell. Even with the set menus it is expensive for the amount of food your are getting. Perhaps not the most effective price point is reached here but transcendence comes at a cost and I'm glad there exists those who reach for that, even for a few bites."
,Theresa N.,"Hubby and I were so excited to check out this place last weekend, we got there 45 minutes before opening to get in line, lol.  I can officially say that was probably not necessary, as other people didn't actually show up until maybe 15-20 minutes prior.  Alas however, our over-achievement paid off!\n\nSeating in this place is limited.  Maybe about 15-20 people inside at a time I think.  You get seated around where all the action is and they make your temaki right there!  You can order the temaki by sets, or a la carte.  We decided to go with Set Go (5), which includes:  Maine lobster, blue crab. spicy toro, negi salmon and bay scallop.  Also ordered the hamachi sashimi as well as the uni ikura temaki.\n\nLet me tell you, eat the roll as soon as they hand it to you.  They are tasty and fresh as hell.  Like, complete melt-in-your-mouth goodness.  Everything in the ingredients, down to the rice, is perfection.   Also, they use premium soy sauce, which is superb with the rolls.  You'll wonder why you never ate them like this before!\n\nI joked with the hubby and said I could eat this everyday.  I haven't, but have been several times this past week =P.  Take all my money already, Junya!!"

,Jasmine C.,"I love that convoy is opening all these new restaurants. J wata sells premium hand rolls. Their menu is set and they will not adjust unless you have allergies. \n\nTbh, this is my first hand roll experience so I don't have anything to compare it to but it was good!\nMy friend and I signed up for their grand opening BOGO special through Facebook. It's happening the weekend of 7/13-7/15 and 7/20-7/22. \n\nThe interior of the place is simple and I really liked the art of the wall. There's limited seatings so the wait can take some time. Each hand roll is made fresh and the chefs don't make the next one until you're done with the one in front of you. It's best to eat it quickly or the seaweed will soften and makes it harder to bite \n\nI ordered the \"

,Jiaxin G.,"I got the weekend one grand opening BOGO special so  we used it for our lunch on Sunday afternoon. We got there around 1:50 and there's a line of about 10 people waiting already. It's not too bad even though we waited a little more than half an hour cause we were able to get some boba tea while we waited. \n\nThe restaurant have only about 22 seats but the turn over was decent. There were two chiefs making hand rolls for everyone. I feel like this temaki bar is not so much for hanging out. It just doesn't feel right to keep the seats for a long time while there's a line waiting outside the restaurant.\n\nAnyways, we got the \"
,Jasmine C.,S P E E C H L E S S ! I have been to many sushi places and this place is one of its own kind. \n\nThe experience was different here. You walk in and there is only a round about bar setting. You sit as if you are in a bar but you order sushi. The sushi is made for you one by one and they hand it to you one at a time. Similar concept to as if you are ordering a drink at the bar and they hand you one drink at a time. \n\nEverything is premium and fresh. Customer service is great. The Sushi Chef was very attentive and he went along with our instagram posts. He smiled on camera when we took pictures of him preparing our food. He was entertaining. \n\nI just hoped the restaurant would be bigger with more seating. There is a higher demand I noticed. My friend and I waited about an hour and a half to get seated. \n\nParking is a mess but there is street parking as well. The food is worth having a struggle with parking.
,Thuong T.,"Three Words: Premium hand rolls.\n\nI love the uniqueness of this Japanese restaurant, specifically brought to you so that you can enjoy a whole new experience of sushi.\nIt is indeed, a very simple dish, and you'd imagine \"
,Jocy C.,"4.5 Stars!!\n\nThis is my first time at a Temaki Bar (specializing in hand rolls)!  J Wata Temaki Bar is currently in soft opening (as of June 2018).  The creator is Junya Watanabe (also the creator of RakiRaki Ramen and Pokirrito Poke).\n\nWe tried the following:\n- Salmon Sashimi\n- Steamed Edamame\n- San Temaki (Blue Crab, Negi Toro, Spicy Salmon)\n- Bay Scallop Standard Roll\n- Maine Lobster Premium Roll\n- Negi Toro Premium Roll\n- Ikura Premium Roll\n- Uni Ikura Premium Roll\n- Ozeki Nigori Sake\n\nLoved the food and freshness overall.  \n#NOMNOMNOM"
,Yoder O.,"Totally blown away by how delicious the food was. I'm giving this place a 5 star although is has some cons but the food and experience was that good.\n\nFood choice: GO x2 (mind-blowingly Delicious)\n\nPros: The hand roll is made fresh right in front of you and served one at a time. It's so freaking delicious that you can't wait for the another one and then another one. The sushi chefs are super friendly and engaging.\n\nCons: The place is small but intimate. We came with a party of 8 and had to be split into 4 groups which was awkward to yell across the room to talk to a friend. The prices are also a bit out of hand but thankfully we came at the grand opening week and got a buy one get one free deal. Lastly, getting the food fresh out of the chef's hand was so unique but also means waiting around for 2 chefs to serve 20 people can be irritating.\n\nOverall: I will be coming back and can't wait to try everything on the menu."
,Catherine F.,"I am a sucker for hand rolls, and being from Los Angeles I have not found that restaurant to give me that fix here in San Diego. \n\nSoft Opening, but was really well put together. The space was all in the middle and for everyone seated to experience and be close to the sushi chef. \n\nFor my Temaki:\n\nI chose the Shi, which included (4) handrolls:\n*Blue Crab\n*Negi Yellowtail- fresh yellowtail and great on the palate.\n*Spicy Tuna- just enough spice\n*Bay Scallop- mayo delicate taste and was one of my favorites\n\nI couldn't resist, and tried from the a la carte as well:\n*Spicy Toro- give me that tuna belly, savory and perfect\n*Uni- it was different with some mint added and tobiko. I enjoyed this handroll the most!\n\nEach Nori is toasted before preparing each handroll, so your handroll is handed to you by the chef each time warm and ready to eat. \n\nI would definitely come back!\n\nStaff- attentive and management as well \nParking- it's Convoy/Kearny Mesa parking at all those plaza's equals patience."
,David L.,"3.43 stars. Its decent, but not for enough that I want to round up to 4 stars. I think if you've had KazuNori in LA before, this experience will fall short. But if you haven't, it should be fine. The fish is fresh enough and the seaweed is toasted, which is unique. The rolls aren't very filling though and the wait time is a little ridiculous. The second time I went, it was an hour wait. Totally not worth it, so I went around the corner for a sushi burrito instead. Twice as filling, half the price, and zero wait. I'd wait maybe 25 minutes for this place tops. Even then, I don't think I'd pay the $20 some dollars for the set menus. It's missing something, I just can't place it."

,Saleen D.,"If you love hand rolls, J Wata Temaki Bar is your place!\n\nThis is owned by the same owners as RakiRaki \u0026 it is just a few doors down from it.  Very busy parking lot!  Save your car from getting a ding by parking on the street!\n\nVery friendly \u0026 attentive customer service!  I love the restaurant's style: a large, hollow square table with the chefs in the middle, seating around the perimeter, \u0026 beautiful art on the walls.  On top of that, the hand rolls are phenomenal!\n\nI came hungry \u0026 tried the following.  All were superb, with my favorites being the Blue Crab, Spicy Salmon, Spicy Toro.\n\nNegi Salmon\nSpicy Salmon\nBlue Crab\nSpicy Toro\nUnagi\nWagyu Shabu"
,Julie N.,"Wow, if I wasn't a struggling college student, you would 100% see me here every week. I came in on a Friday around 5ish with my friend. My friend and I wanted to get Cauldron, but we wanted to get something small and savory before we got ice cream. \n\nWe saw that J/Wata was open so we went to try it out. This place only serves hand rolls and the menu is small, but boy did everything sound amazing. Hand rolls were around $5-6 per roll, a little on the pricey side but for the fresh ingredients, I totally understand why. \n\nMy friend and I just wanted 1 roll each because something savory for our taste buds was all we wanted. I got the negi toro and she got the avo/wasabi/mayo. The chef prepares it right in front of you and personally gives you the hand roll. The roll was so flavorful with really great ingredients, you can taste how fresh it was. I'm not even a fan of mayo or wasabi, and the avo wasabi mayo roll was so good. \n\nStaff members and the chef were super nice and welcoming! I can't wait to return, but definitely with my mom or dad next time!"
,Sandra S.,"My friend and I came at around 10:45am during the soft opening, and there wasn't a wait, plus plenty of parking in the notoriously difficult parking lot that the restaurant is located in. The restaurant is very small, with about twenty seats at a sushi counter top. In the middle, the chefs make the hand rolls, while people sit around the sushi bar. \n\nI was somewhat skeptical of how good a hand roll could be, but to my surprise, the experience was very good. We went for the four-piece hand roll set that came with spicy salmon, scallops, yellowtail, and blue crab. My favorite of the four was yellowtail, since it was the sashimi in its pure form without any additional toppings or add ins. The scallop and blue crab rolls had fillings mixed with a mayonnaise type of sauce, and the spicy salmon was only mildly spicy.\n\nThe rice was soft and well seasoned, and the nori was crispy and warm. The cool fish contrasted well with the warm rice and nori, and I highly recommend eating it the second the chef hands it to you! The service was also very good, and the waitress was very attentive of our needs throughout the dining experience. I feel like this place will get busy really soon, so I would recommend coming early or before it opens to ensure a spot. Also, this restaurant isn't too good for large crowds, but it's perfect for a 2-3 people lunch date."
,Curtis T.,"We were trying to get into Kura Robota Sushi Bar. After waiting for 45 minutes, we did a Yelp search and found J Wata Temaki Bar. This is a new restaurant in an area that is packed with Chinese, Korean, Thai, and Japanese restaurants. There are no tables, but only sushi counters. The restaurant primarily serves rolls. There are specialty rolls from 3 (San) to 5 (Go). The Go is the best \"
,Ashley D.,"I was ecstatic to see a hand roll place pop up in SD as I have been wanting to try Kazunori in LA but have never gotten the chance to. This small store is opened by the owner of Pokerito and Raki Raki, so you can bet its located right in the same plaza. \n\nA friend and I came at 11 before grand opening and we were the only party eating except one other party. We went with the Shi ($16.95) that came with 4 handrolls. Each one was prepared right in front of us. It was fascinating watching the chef crisp up the nori over the fire and roll each hand roll carefully. You really do have to eat each one fast as if not, the seaweed gets soggy and the rest of the rice and fish can fall out of the end of the roll. The warm rice is one of my favorite about this place and places like Sugarfish. If you have not tried sushi with warm rice and it sounds odd to you, try it here! It is amazing. My favorite roll was the yellowtail one as it was the lightest and most natural in flavor. \n\nBecause it was only in soft opening, I had very low expectations and was not expecting to be impressed by anything here. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The fish tasted fresh and the warm rice and crispy combination was great. I don't know if I would come back any time soon as the wait will probably tremendous, but its a great experience to have at least once."

,Alanna C.,"Came here for the BOGO grand opening event. The wait was around 25 min to get seated ( there are only around 25 or so seats- would be difficult for large parties). \n\nSushi is always on the expensive side... and this place is no exception, each hand roll is around $4-$5. And around 4 bites in size. It was nice they were having the BOGO otherwise this restaurant would be slightly out of my price range. \n\nThe service was quick, after ordering (shi and go sets) it took about 7 min for the chef to greet us and then another 3-4 min to get our roll. Their style is to serve one roll at a time for ultimate freshness. Between each roll there was a 3-4 min wait for the next. \n\nMy favorites were the lobster (very tender and the crunch of the seaweed added texture to the lobster) and the blue crab. The scallops had too much mayonnaise for me. I also enjoyed the spicy salmon.\n\nThe concept of this place is innovative and new so I feel like that will attract people even if the food is pricey and parking is somewhat difficult. \n\nI would probably be back if they had another deal just on pricey side for me although the food is delicious and atmosphere is nice!"
,Emmett T.,"I had been waiting for this place to open when I first heard about it last year. It's a small, chic bar that seats roughly 20 people so I guess I was fortunate when I arrived as only about half the spots were occupied. I parked a couple of blocks away and walked over since I knew it would be a crap shoot trying to find a space in that plaza.\n\nAfter you are seated, the server explains how to order the hand rolls from the menu sheet. You mark what you want and then hand the slip to him/her who then informs the chefs behind the bar on what to make. The best value comes from ordering one of the three preset options. I chose the Go ($21.75) which came as five rolls: Blue Crab, Spicy Toro, Negi Salmon, Bay Scallop, Maine Lobster. I also picked a Wagyu Shabu roll ($7.75) a la carte.\n\nI liked how the chefs took each piece of nori and warmed it to a crisp over a gas flame before adding the ingredients. Each roll came out cylindrical in shape (instead of conical like at most Japanese restaurants) and was handed to you individually as the chef finished wrapping it. All the components tasted very fresh. My favorite of the ones I tried was the bay scallop.\n\nThe a la carte prices were pretty reasonable as I normally see hand rolls selling between $4 and $5 apiece. All the regular temaki were priced less than $5 while the premium temaki ranged from $5.75 to $7.75. They are currently in their soft opening for the remainder of this week. The plan is to go to their full operating hours early next week according to one of the managers who checked up on me before and after my meal."
,Christopher L.,"Temaki is a concept that is new to me personally and honestly I enjoyed it. \n\nWe went for their grand opening event where it was buy one set menu, get one free which was a great deal! \n\nWe were seated right way when the place opened and were told about how their restaurant system works. After ordering our set menu, a chef would make our rolls and literally hand it to us one by one. They suggested we eat it right away to get the full effect of the roasted seaweed texture along with whatever filling we got. \n\nWe got the Go set menu which everything was pretty tasty. They use this sweet cream sauce to mix their fish in which complimented the crab, lobster, and scallops really well. I can imagine for the seafood connoisseurs though that they would feel like the cream over powered the actual meat but whatever.  The scallop to me was amazing. It's individual sweetness came through perfectly. The roasted seaweed wrap had a perfect crunch, something I've never experienced before. I guess the fact that it is roasted seconds before it is served to you really makes a difference. \n\nThe vibe I got from the restaurant was pretty cool. It was like modern and classic japanese decor infused together. \n\nThe whole meal experience was laid back and gave you the opportunity to relax and chat with whoever you're eating with. Don't expect a quick meal especially if there are a lot of people being served. The rolls came every few minutes which allowed me to savor each bit and get all the flavors. \n\nI recommend coming here to give it a try and see if you like it!"
,Lori T.,"Came in during their soft opening and I'll start by saying that I'm looking forward to seeing their menu expand because everything that we ordered was good.\n\nThe hand rolls are made fresh one at a time in front of you and it's best to eat them right away to maintain the fresh crunch of the seaweed. My mistake was taking my time in snapping pics of my first few handrolls haha. The blue crab and scallop rolls were my favorite - the blue crab was slightly sweet and the meat was refreshing, light, and fresh by the smell of it. The scallop was just the same - slightly sweet with a clean aftertaste and texture. The salmon and hamachi sashimi were both served with just the right amount of accompanying ponzu and wasabi and the slices were fresh. My rec is to go for the \"
,Lydia T.,"I love when an establishment sticks to one thing and does it well! J Wata is the spot for yummy small handrolls with crisp seaweed. OMG.\n\nIt's just a small u-shaped bar, modern and intimate. \nThe miso was tasty! \n\nWe selected the \"
,Ryan L.,"Went with a friend for the grand opening event. The atmosphere was pretty cool. I liked the art on the walls, music, and lighting. Service was ok. \n\nWe were seated in these lower seats in the dining area which were kind of secluded. It was  out of the way so we couldn't see the sushi chef making stuff and he would only briefly come over to give us our rolls. We could also see the trash behind the counter and the guy bussing dirty dishes was coming right in front of us.\n\nThe menu has sets of handrolls that go from 3, 4, or 5 rolls or vegetarian as well as a la carte rolls, appetizers, etc. \n\nWe got the \"
,Marika D.,"Man, I had such high expectations for this place being an avid consumer of seafood and Japanese cuisine. But it really did not live up to it in the slightest bit. \n\nFor a place that specializes in hand rolls, they sure make a sloppy one. It's very hard to eat without them falling apart. I do like that they warm up the seaweed and that it has a nice crunch. But inside the nori is 75% rice. Very little seafood, which wouldn't be an issue if the price was affordable. But these are expensive handrolls at $5-10 each. \n\nThe San, which included Negi Toro, Spicy Salmon \u0026 Blue Crab, was very unsatisfying. They were all so heavily marinated that you couldn't taste the fish itself. Especially the crab was more mayo tasting than anything.\n\nWe also ordered the hamachi sashimi to get a change from all the rice. Yellowtail is my favorite fish, and I find that it is usually good even at mediocre sushi spots. But this one was actually pretty bad.  It was served room temperature and the texture tasted somewhat dry. This confirmed to me that the fish they use here is not the freshest and highest of quality. \n\nIn my opinion, they need to source better seafood and use less sauce/rice, or reduce their prices to match the quality. \n\n+1 star for the ambiance\n+1 for the concept"
,Rammy C.,"The wait is worth it. If you're a major sashimi fan and love handrolls this place is amazing. Handrolls come as you finish so that you get them fresh and enjoy the full flavors of the fish and toasted nori. The negi toro, scallops, blue crab and waygu are the best. Order a lot cuz you'll want more. \n\nAnd chef Brian was so great to us."
,Adrienne A.,"Oh man, where do I begin? \n\nEverything I had was DELICIOUS! *****\n\nSpicy Salmon- Perfect!\n\nSpicy Toro- Perfect! \n\nThe Blue Crab was my favorite :) \n\nI had no warning before I bit into the Uni special... my mouth went on a journey through the universe. So many flavors~\n\nThanking my lucky stars !! I was given fresh raw wasabi... I ate all of it. I think it got me high :D just kidding, I know it did!!! \nEven the wasabi you are normally given here was the best I've ever had, as well as the ginger.\n\nThe Chefs oh ma gaaaaaaaaaaaaaa GORGEOUS!!! Faints :) \n\nBig crazy parking lot!!!!! I will avoid places if parking is to difficult, but for this? For this I will fight! I will take you DOWWWN!!! LoL \n\nFantastic service! Great decor to stare at after you're high from the wasabi and delicious food :D \n\nNice restrooms! \n\nSee you in my dreams!"
,Steve H.,"Soft opening as of 7/7, so menu may change.\n\nIt's in the TightParKing Stripmall with RakiRaki.  Don't even try..  street park three blocks away and walk.\n\nThis place is all bar seating, one big U shape.  This makes the service personal and direct.  Friendly, fresh, and.. uniquely human.  The chef makes each handroll and hands it to you directly.  Pacing is up to you.  Very nice, and an easy place to dine solo or small parties.\n\nI went with the midsize 4-roll combo.  No substitutions, but cheaper than the same rolls individually.\n\nI'd call it lunch-sized..  you won't leave stuffed or starving.  These are open ended rolls, not the more common conical ones.  It's just rice and mixed fish ingredients, fresh, but without the greens and garnishes you might be expecting.\n\nThe flavors were good, but the hand roll format just doesn't floor me.  It's smaller than a sushi roll, and more seaweed-shell/nori than regular nigiri sushi.  The contents are good, but get a bit overshadowed in all that crunch and wrap, especially near the ends.\n\nBest value on the menu was the hamachi sashimi, with jalapeno slices.  Very fresh thick slices, artfully arranged.  I would get that again.\n\nIced green tea was just a UCC can, not the fresh matcha you get at Ken's.  Wasabi was really weak, just vanished.  Value was a bit on the expensive side, especially compared to Pokeritto next door.\n\nService was very helpful and friendly, but this one-format menu might not be for everyone.  Five stars for service and novelty, but I think once was enough for me."
,Alexa O.,"Best Temaki I've had. The fish was fresh, the seaweed was warm \u0026 not dry, the rice was warm \u0026 not dry. Highly recommend! I tried the negi salmon, spicy salmon, unagi (eel) my personal favorite, yellowtail, Maine lobster, scallops, spicy tuna \u0026 all were amazing! \n\nI'd only come here solo or with 1 other person, definitely not good for children.  The place is super small \u0026 only seats a handful around 1 entire table/bar in the whole place. Food comes out 1 item you order at a time, it's nice to pace yourself \u0026 really enjoy it."
,Sang P.,Came here around 11:15 AM on a weekday. The place was about 30% full. I ordered the \
,Jessica S.,"Traditionally, temaki is made from leftovers and packed as a lunch, SO only in America will you see it offered in a restaurant and as an exotic, high-end dinner item. This 'bar' serves temaki strictly; seating is very limited. Typically, temaki is cone-shaped, but this restaurant and others have been going with the super hip 'rolled taco' version. Nori is held over a flame to warm and crisp it, then the rice is packed in with the protein on top. It is rolled by your chef and handed to you on the spot. \n\nWe came during the soft opening, so there wasn't much of a wait just before 6pm hit. Options at the time offered 3 set menus and some items a la carte. A little irked that the set menus included a little disclaimer of 'no sharing'. Who the hell are they to tell me how to eat MY food that I paid for!? Anyways, I went for *Shi* which included blue crab, negi yellowtail, spicy salmon, and bay scallop for $16.75. Sound a bit pricey? Indeed it is and you won't feel full after 4. I did mightily enjoyed the bay scallops the most though -- such a pop of freshness with the creamy mayo serving as a marinade. The others options were alright. Most seemed to rely heavily on the marinade. In that respect I did enjoy the *wagyu shabu* which I did have to order a la carte for a $7.75! This did not have a marinade and you were able to enjoy the lusciousness of the meat itself. The offering of wagyu was small and because of that I don't believe the $7.75 was a fair price. I wasn't a fan of the *negi toro* as it had a funny texture since it was a bit mashed up. I guess that's how it normally is so it does take some getting used to. \n\nNori was ever so slightly warm and it maybe offered a little crunch. Rice was ON POINT though. In addition to the freshness of the fish, the rice is definitely another important component and they make it right here; moist, but firm. \n\nI am fairly certain the owner of RakiRaki will kill it though since there is nothing like this San Diego. I have a love-hate relationship with the man, but he offered a polished menu in a very well thought out and aesthetically pleasing restaurant. Congratulations on capitalizing on the next cool concept Junya Watanabe!"
,Sherilyn R.,For everyone wondering if this place is as good as Kazunori in LA - it is. Maybe even a little better.\n\nI got the \
,Isabella B.,"After the successes of RakiRaki and Pokiritto chef-owner Junya Watanabe has launched another restaurant concept - this time focusing on temaki (hand rolls). While there are plenty of sushi places that serve rolls or nigiri, not a lot of restaurants even offer temaki on the menu, much less exclusively serve them. Before this restaurant existed I could only get good handrolls from the famous Sugarfish as part of their set menu. At least now I don't have to go that far for temaki.\n\nLOCATION: Convoy/Kearny Mesa in the same complex as the original Rakiraki and Pokiritto. As with any other restaurant in that area, parking situation's awful but at least this is my only negative critique about the restaurant.\n\nVENUE: The restaurant's pretty small. A central sushi bar seats 22. Three to four chefs toast the nori in these special clay pots that contain the flame. \n\nSERVICE: Friendly service. Hostess kept on asking us how our experience was. \nThe temaki is assembled right in front of you; they toast the nori, scoop the rice and fish, roll it and hand it to you. No need for chopsticks and oshibori is provided to wipe your hands before touching the sushi.\n\nOur party chose from a set menu. My mom also included salmon sashimi ($7.25) as well as an additional negi yellowtail temaki ($4.75). Salmon sashimi was fresh. Didn't need so much sesame and soy sauce.\n\nSet Menu - Go [5] ($21.75)\nThere is a progression in the seafood that goes from the lightest to the heaviest.\n1. Maine Lobster: the lightest temaki, as it should be. The lobster is already diluted with rice. They use a good quality lobster for this roll.\n2. Spicy Toro: Salmon and tuna have both a spicy and a negi variation. The fish is pounded until the final product resembles cat food. There is enough hotness for it to be noticeable but not too much that it takes over the fish.\n3. Negi Salmon: The negi in this case refers to green onion. In this case it lessens the fishy flavor. Since I'm not served the fatty parts of the fish I like #2 and #3 equally.\n4. Bay Scallop: The bay scallop has mayonnaise in it and served warm. Final product is still quite delicious.\n5. Blue Crab: Lots of good crab meat. Though I prefer Sugarfish's version, the blue crab is still fresh.\nRice - Sushi-grade rice cooked in a small batch technique seasoned with 3 types of vinegar.\nNori - Gold labeled seaweed sourced from Yamamotoyama\n\nMy parents and I came during their soft opening. We were pretty impressed with our experience in terms of quality of food and service. I could see this restaurant ending up in our regular rotation for places to go out, especially as good Japanese food is hard to find. Just bear the parking."
,Kyle C.,"Kept the expectations really low walking in but wanted to see if toasted seaweed was really worth it. Seated in the observation booth and started out with the hamachi yellow tail sashimi. Fresh and fatty. The ponzu sauce and jalape\u00f1o over it was really good. Ended up getting the 4 course: blue crab, yellow tail, bay scallop and salmon. Honestly seeing them toast the seaweed and presenting it to you was a one of a kind experience. Not to sound like a effing snob but fuck that was delicious. The rice, with the freshness of the seafood and the crunch of the seaweed. The best hand rolls hands down. A beer, the sashimi and 4 rolls ran me $30. Came 40 minutes after open and not that crowded. Not sure how the wait would be during rush but still pretty good. \n\nThis is quality over quantity so I wouldn't expect to get full but who wants to feel like shit after eating high quality sushi. \n\nMy chef and another patron found out we were from the 562 as well so the experience of meeting familiar people was nice. Ask for James for your chef!"
,Jannie T.,"The whole experience was very underwhelming for me. Service was decent, I wasn't too happy that I had to ask my chef almost each time what handroll he was serving me. He would put it in my hand and walk away without saying anything. The idea of the nori being crispy sounds cool but parts of the nori would sometimes get stuck to the roof of my mouth. I really liked bay scallops and the blue crab hand rolls. I ordered the ikura and uni handroll and was NOT thrilled there was a mint (?) leaf in there! It overtook the flavor of the ikura and uni. Sigh :(\n\nGlad I came here for the BOGO set offer. I don't think I'll be back. Handrolls were 3.5/5 stars good but not worth the size and price I'm paying for."
,Walter M.,"First things first, the price will probably give pause to many \"
,Candice L.,"I mean, wow! First of all, great service and the was very friendly! I came for a BOGO promotion during their grand opening so there was a bit of a line but well worth it! I got the GO option which has Maine Lobster included, my fav! The soy was is double fermented (bomb) and the wasabi wasn't that fake stuff.  Not a huge spicy tuna fan but this wasn't the best spicy tuna I've ever had! It was FRESH! Must come here for some hand-rolls!  A bit on the smaller side, but he beat quality."
,Christine T.,My family wanted to go here while they were visiting me a few weeks ago because there aren't any good hand roll bars in OC. We ordered the Go set menu as well as the waygu shabu and uni hand rolls. Everything was delicious and fresh. They even have real wasabi which is a major plus! \n\nParking can kind of be crazy in this plaza like many places on Convoy.
,Adrienne V.,"I'm definitely one that likes a lot of choices but the simplicity of their menu does not take away from the delicious quality of their food. It's not your typical sushi spot with a ton of different rolls and as I'm sure you know by now, they specialize in Temaki aka hand rolls. I still enjoy crazy over the top rolls from time to time but I feel like with sushi, the simpler the better so that you can really taste and appreciate the ingredients. You can order in \"
,Cindy T.,"This was such a nice place! A co-worker and I went on the Friday before the Grand Opening and I tried the Go (5). This experience was really interesting because there is a chef in the center of the restaurant making your rolls as you eat them. They hand them directly into your hands and makes them on the spot! My favorite roll was the Bay Scallop, which was so fresh with the warm sushi rice and mixed in some kind of mayo sauce. Every roll is light and refreshing. I would say 5 was just enough to feel satisfied and not bloated. \n\nThe menu is set and be careful if you have seafood allergies. The restaurant is a bit small and has maybe about 15-20 seats around in a bar setting!"
,Maria P.,\
,Claire D.,"Very happy that San Diego now has a temaki bar! Ever since I went to Kazunori in LA I was hoping we would get one. They are still in their soft opening so the hours aren't set. They would be an ideal quick but delicious (and pricey) lunch, although parking might take too long to visit on a standard lunch break. Really, that parking lot is insane. And some times you can't even find anything 2 blocks on the street in any direction! Anyway...\n\nThe menu is simple and the quality of the food is good. The only problem I had is that the rolls kind of fell apart a bit. If you tried to turn it anything but vertical rice fell into the soy. If you held it vertical and took a bite, rice fell out the bottom. Maybe this is something they could fix in the future. My husband and I got 4 handrolls each and it was a $40 lunch without tip. The freshly crisped nori makes it so good though. I like it and hope to come back soon."
,Yoav L.,I've been waiting for this place to open for a while. So fresh and so good. \nEvery single thing in the menu is top notch and won't disappoint. \nThe only problem I see is that price for lunch per person will be around $30 which is kinda of pricey even tough it's super fresh and tasty.
,Myphuong L.,TIP: Do not come starving. You will leave disappointed and still hungry then make your way down to Caldron to fill yourself on the puffle like we did. I would consider this a snack or delicate meal.\n\nCame here at 6:30pm during soft opening (6/10/) and the place had three others seated. Which was a bit awkward when literally everyone can hear your conversations due to the confined space. Especially the chef directly in front of you.\n\nWe were told each roll was crafted carefully and recommended to be eaten as soon as it was handed to you. That's exactly what we did. It was so good that I forgot to take photos! We ordered the 4 roll set menu and the scallop was my number one but they were all delicious.
,AnnBam W.,"This place recently opened and I gotta say, the rolls were great and really fresh. You can taste the quality of the ingredients used. The staff was also attentive, coming just frequent enough to ask if we want more water or ginger. James was our chef and he was very friendly and inviting. I recommend anyone who enjoys hand rolls and sashimi to try this place out!!"
,Tom L.,"Finally a Temaki Bar on convoy!\n\nShort: Slightly pricy fancy sushi \n\nLong: Coming from LA, one of my favorite things to do is to go get \"
,Joecylin Deean R.,"This place is phenomenal.. I found this spot on the Hot \u0026 new so I had to try it out for myself since I am a die hard sushi lover! Upon entering the server seats us \u0026 gives us a run down of how to order things. They have a small simple menu selection so this place is not somewhere to get SUPER full at without spending some moneeeyyy. \n\nPrice: honestly for the way the restaurant is set up \u0026 that each hand roll is made 1 at a time after you finish each one I knew it wouldn't be some cheap sushi spot price. My bf and I ordered the set of 5 rolls for $21 which is fair enough for the experience!  \u0026 also 2 ala carte Wagyu Shabu beef ones.\n\nFood: lemme tell you..... each one I ate had so much flavor I was eating it so slow I didn't want it to go away. LOL the order we had was \n1.Negi Salmon\n2.Bay Scallop \n3.Maine Lobster \n4. Spicy Toro \n5. Blue crab \n\nAnd we paid an extra $8 for each of us to try the wagyu beef one since there was so many reviews that recommended it. Honestly I would never order a hand roll anywhere else ever again. I love how our chef explained to us their concept.\n\nMade into cylinders instead of traditional cone shape- to ensure equal distribution for the rice and fish! \n\nMade to order ( one at a time to you finish it) - so the rice stays warm, the seaweed stays nice and crisp and the fish doesn't harden up or get warm.\nAll these tips were so helpful and the experience is something to try out! The wagyu beef one topped it all off.. so tender and juicy that I was really about to order another one. We will definitely be back. We didn't eat all day and this actually filled us up! We were at a good full."
,Nathan C.,Pretty decent. But missing one star due to not particularly special tastes from some maki and sashimi on their menu. Their Sashimi is soaked in ponzu. Too much sauce it loses the original taste. Don't like to put good fish marinated in a cheap  sauce. Blue crab and Main lobster makis are 5 stars. All the other you can taste them at other sushi places. For that reason I give 4 Star. But blue crab and main lobster were awesome. ! Yeah I'm rather picky eater.
,Lopez D.,This is already a hot spot and it hasn't even officially opened yet.  I went with a few foodie friends and they all said this is the best they've had. From the raw wasabi to the rolls ...and that yellowtail collar! A must.
,Lauren G.,"Such a great experience to add to the Convoy area!\n\nFreshly opened, this Temaki Bar really presents high quality ingredients and fresh hand rolls to guests. It's the perfect place for a date or a meaningful catch up with friends or family.\n\nYou are seated at a rectangular open bar with the chefs in the center. There's limited seating, so smaller parties definitely will work better - which also helps with the intimate attention you get from the chefs.\n\nThe walls have some amazing art to really add to the hip and classy atmosphere.\n\nThere are a few preset menus and individual rolls you can order - each with their own special umami to them! \n\nI had the first set on the menu, Sashimi Appetizer, and a Wagyu Beef Hand Roll and was very impressed with the quality.\n\nHighly recommend the savory Sashimi Appetizer! It meltsssssss into your taste buds!\n\nOur servers were very nice and attentive and our chef who presented the hand rolls to us over the counter recommended we eat them quickly to enjoy the full quality and perfected temperatures.\n\nA really great dining experience to try and live the good food life!"
,Stefanie H.,Cannot say enough good things about my first experience dining here. All of the food was extremely fresh and flavorful. The staff were attentive and friendly. The time spaced out between each handroll is perfect enough to thoroughly enjoy each different one. My personal favorite was the bay scallop. Highly recommend coming for both the food and experience!!
,Johnathan C.,"This is a fantastic sushi bar. The chic decor and comfortable seats greet patrons as they enter, and the menu provides options for dedicated sushi diners as well as vegetarian friends. The wait staff takes orders and attentively serves throughout the meal. The chefs present hand rolls one by one, all carefully prepared and deliciously flavored. Each roll has a uniquely wonderful taste that is elevated by its warm rice and flame-crisped nori. To eat here is to know delicious sushi."
,Siddharth D.,"Great fresh food, small menu selection which means better quality of food and top service"
,Mike C.,"I was in town for a quick day business trip and decided to stop in for dinner. This place looks modern from the outside with the wood trim. Inside, the mural reminds me of \"
,John H.,"It was my first night in SD and my plan was to just jump between a bunch of different restaurants--J Wata being the very first. On my flight out of SD, though all the restaurants I had hopped around to were great, J Wata just stayed on my mind and I would definitely go back to try everything on the menu. \n\nReading other reviews, you'll quickly find out the format of this place: you select what you want on a piece, pass it to a server, and the server will pass it to the chef (who is right in front of you). He'll make each roll in your order one by one, meticulously toasting the seaweed over an small, open flame while parsing through what you and everyone else has ordered on a tablet. Once the seaweed is toasted and he assembles the hand roll, he'll pass it directly to your hands for you to consume.\n\nI only had a few hand rolls and a miso soup but every single bite I had was so amazing. I wasn't even able to take any pictures because waiting any longer than 30 seconds made the nori less and less crisp and you really have to have the roll go from the chef right to your mouth. The rice was great and the seafood was incredibly fresh.\n\nAnother great thing about this format is that, as a guest, you do not have to wait long before you get your first bite. The chef rotates making rolls between guests so everyone is satisfied. In some sort of way, it's good that you have to wait because you spread out your experience and are able to enjoy eat bite on its own, letting the flavors in your mouth truly sink in before haphazardly moving onto your next piece.\n\nMy only issue is that each roll is fairly expensive--about $4-7 each from what I remember--but it is really worth it and I would not mind splurging here once in a while if I was a local."
,William B.,"I came during the grand opening weekend with a BOGO deal (two sets for the price of one). With the BOGO deal, I do think the price is worth it. However, if I were paying the regular price, this place would be a poor value, especially considering that I wasn't full even after 5 rolls. While the concept and setting is cool, overall the quality of the ingredients is not much better than that used at Pokerrito a couple doors down (given the fact that they are owned by the same owner, I wouldn't be surprised if they used the same exact ingredients). In fact, none of the ingredients are freshly prepared; they are all scooped out of tins you would find at Chipotle and then are assembled like a burrito. At the end of the day, you're paying $22 (before tax + tip) for 5 tiny handrolls when you can walk 20 feet over to Pokerrito and experience 1 humongous handroll (aka sushi burrito) made with the same exact ingredients for less than half the price (with no tip). Or, you could go to a real sushi restaurant and pay the same price for a real sushi chef to prepare handrolls for you with better and fresher ingredients. If they lowered the price by 25% or improved the quality of their ingredients, I would consider going again but at the moment, you're certainly overpaying for what you get.\n\nTaste: 2.5/5 Value: 1/5 Experience: 3.5/5"
,Sachin D.,"I went here with a few friends the other night. Being a vegetarian, I wasn't too sure what to expect but did see that they had a few options on the menu. The restaurant is very stylish and all seating is bar style. The staff is extremely attentive and each seat comes ready with wasabi and fresh ginger. The menu is simple, high-quality hand rolls. Ideally, one would order one of three set menus that vary in size from 3 to 5 hand rolls. I ordered a la carte since I was getting the vegetarian options. \n\nI ordered three hand rolls: mayo avocado, shiitake mushroom, and a Japanese root vegetable one (the name I cannot recall) with shisho. All are made to order, and one at a time. They were all delicious. The manager or owner also said I hard to try the last vegetarian option which was a fresh ginger and shisho hand roll, it was very refreshing and ON THE HOUSE. \n\nMy friends ordered the 3 or 4 temaki hand roll sets and they loved them. \n\nOverall, a nice, unique place that is taking the time to do simple food extremely well. \n\nDefinitely would go back here."
,Jen T.,"I have been coming to this place way too much. I am a bit obsessed with it though.\n\nI love the simplicity of J Wata. They do strictly hand rolls with 1 or 2 sashimi specials. \n\nI have eaten almost every single type here. If you are new, try one of their pre set menus. They give you a great variety and pricing is slightly better than just ordering a la carte. \n\nMy favorites are:\nBlue Crab\nSpicy Toro\nNegi Salmon\n\nThe chef will hand you each roll one by one with the intention of you eating it right away to preserve the crispness of the nori with each bite. They only have counter seating for about 20ish people, so it may be difficult to come with a big group or with small children. I have taken my 3 year old daughter here and she does well as she loves sushi/sashimi. \n\nA great addition to SD food scene as it is unique. Parking is a nightmare but worth it. I come here and then head over to Cauldron for dessert."
,Kevin D.,"Great new spot! The contrast of flavored from the sticky rice, fish, and fresh crunchy nori. My favorites: hamachi (yellowtail), and blue crab"
,Vanessa C.,"Awesome and fun! This is my first time getting the hand roll experience at the bar. I've been to plenty of sushi bars and this felt very similar! It is currently still in soft opening, so the menu suggestion is pretty limited. They have different \"
,Cid I.,"Actual rating: ** 3.5 stars \n(since yelp doesn't allow half stars)\n\nHaving tried Kazunori in LA and be an avid fanatic of the place, I was curious of J Wata ever since I caught wind of it on Eater. Still on their soft opening, there are a handful of things they can still improve on and hopefully they will. Of course, I have a great feeling that J Wata will constantly be compared to Kazunori for those who have had the pleasure of experiencing both. That being said, the food and service were quite alright given that they are still getting things situated. I still have to say my review greatly compares my experience at J Wata against Kazunori, glossing over some aspects and concentrating on others.\n\nLayout: The layout of both eateries are the same. Limited seats surrounding the chefs. I want to say that the number available seats are similar, but the number of chefs serving are lesser at J Wata. The art on the walls was definitely cool though, depicting a Japanese style anime biker gang with one side having a red bike - reminding me greatly of Akira.\n\nService: \nIf memory serves me right, a huge difference is that there are more chefs serving you at Kazunori. I recall having to wait maybe a minute or two tops after finishing my handroll to receive another at Kazunori even when it was jam packed. During my visit to J Wata, the place was half full and had two chefs working the booths. The chefs were working as best they could, but could not keep up with how fast a person might take to eat their roll. I definitely waited a bit after finishing each one. I would hope and suggest that a third chef is brought in once the soft opening is over with. \n\nI do have to point out that the order tracking devices they were using were malfunctioning a bit so that could have added to the delay. As for the chef himself and the wait staff, they were all quite polite and relatively attentive. Nothing bad to say there. \n\nPrice:\nI was a little disappointed in this category. Kazunori definitely has this point beat as the hand rolls there are noticeably cheaper by set and per roll. As it stands, the pricing at J Wata makes me hesitate returning... at least not as much as I visit Kazunori.\n\n\nFood: \nNow here is the part I have to emphasize that I am REALLY comparing this place to Kazunori. It's hard to ignore that J Wata probably takes after Kazunori. The ordering system is the same where you can order hand rolls a-la-carte or as a set. I got a set and ordered something on the side. \n\nThe nori is toasted per roll in order to have them crisp and break apart when you bite into it. Personally, I feel like this wasn't executed perfectly because the center of the nori of each roll I had was chewy, causing the filling (fish and rice) to fall out on the other end. The ends were fine but the center was the problematic point. Kazunori has this down and I don't recall ever having to struggle on any of my visits.\n\nThe rice was good, standardly seasoned as any other sushi restaurant. Even so, there is a stark difference as Kazunori and the Nozawa shops distinctly season their rice. I could taste the difference between the rolls of J Wata and Kazunori. You'd have to try Kazunori or Nozawa to know what I am referring to. By preference, I prefer Kazunori's seasoning more because it allowed me to enjoy the roll without using soy sauce.\n\nThe fish was definitely fresh. Nothing was fishy so I very much enjoyed that. I ordered the 4 set, which included  blue crab, negi yellowtail, spicy salmon, and bay scallops. They were all good and seasoned decently, but I can't say they were great or amazing. Again by preference, I feel that Kazunori wins out again in this category. Both places, the fish was was unmistakably fresh, but Kazunori just adds something else more to the fish to amplify the flavor. My favorite at Kazunori, the blue crab, was a bit more muted at J Wata. For every roll following it, the same sentiment was had.\n\nOverall, J Wata is not a bad place. Despite me making it sound like they are a mess, it's good. It's just that, in my opinion, it has very big shoes to fill if they are actually modeling themselves after Kazunori. There's good reason that Kazunori and Nozawa constantly has lines out the door. I just truly hope that J Wata works it out or establishes itself to be a real contender in the future once the dust has settled."
,Julie S.,"This place is amazing. From the super talented chefs to the super friendly staff, the entire place earns its 5 stars! Come for the ambiance but stay for the food. The Spicy Tuna hand roll blew my mind and miso soup kicks some serious ass. Do your self a favor and stop by J Wata for some delicious food."
,Wynn M.,"I think the Raki family is trying to take over this overcrowded, terribly awful parking strip mall. This is a novel new Temaki Bar essentially perfecting sushi hand rolls. The seaweed nori is toasted and crisp for each roll. Quality of ingredients is very good so far on opening. Prices can add up quickly - e.g the lobster roll costs ~ $7.50 and can be finished in 2-3 man bites - you'll end up nibbling them to make the rolls go farther.   Most of the rolls are $5-6 or so. The set menus are a little better. Good food but don't go hungry. An upgrade from Raki - never very impressed by them but they do pack 'em in."
,Alan D.,"Awesome place. My girlfriend has celiac's and has to do gluten-free (GF). They were very, very attentive to that and made sure to highlight the items in the menu that were gluten free. They also have gluten free soy sauce.\n\nThe hand rolls were EXCELLENT. I loved the negi salmon, bay scallops, and the Maine lobster. The blue crab hand roll was extremely fresh and amazing. The seaweed was wonderfully crispy, the rice was good, and the fish was fresh.\n\nThis was their soft opening so I don't know what it will be like after the grand opening. I would suggest a more  sake selection, but that's my only complaint. I loved the casual bar setting, fast service, and great service.\n\nUpdate: They had a highlighted menu up front for the servers to reference so they knew what was gluten free. The manager remembered my girlfriend and I from our last visit and he told us about some of the recipe changes they made, including changing the mayo they use so the hand rolls (blue crab, Maine lobster, bay scallop) were GF now. Awesome that they were willing to make that accommodation we appreciated that they remembered us."
,Suzan Y.,"It's solid. However, I don't think it was mind blowingly good for the price that you pay. My brother definitely left still hungry, so we went to another store to grab more food.\n\nThe chef was very nice though!"
,Drew C.,"Delicious and hip. The quality of the rolls is outstanding. They put a great deal of effort into making each roll by hand and make sure it comes out perfect each time. The service was outstanding too, whenever we needed anything they were able to provide it quickly. I was very surprised of the price for the quality, you're definitely getting your money's worth here. \n\nI recommend coming to try it out. This is going to become a very popular place in San Diego."
,Gina B.,I got 2 Negri Salmon and a Negri Toro..each made and handed to me one at a time.. wow.. these are way yummier than any other place.. they sear the nori (seaweed) so it's crisp.. then they create the perfect size roll for easy eating. The fish was divine and the sushi rice perfection..this exceeded my expectations. I equate it to eating in Italy where they use very few but quite exceptional ingredients. The service was spot on as well.. this is a perfect place to start with a lil something as u wait for your table at Raki Raki Ramen
,Amanda C.,"Overall experience is just okie. Coming from LA we are very blessed to have Kazu Nori. Therefore when compared I would still pick Kazu Nori. \n\nFreshness of the fish is very good. However I think the lobster and the crab marination could be changed. I can definitely taste the wateriness residue from the protein. Maybe they need to squeeze out the excess water before mixing their mayo and seasoning. \n\nI did not like the part where we can not take out the spicy option from the set menu. Some people may prefer non spicy. \n\nAlso the order of how the fish is presented is very random. I think it would be better if they presented the fish according to light to heavy. I started with lobster which I think messes up the taste palette. So maybe start with toro, salmon, scallops, crab, lobster. \n\nThey heated the seaweed which was interesting. I would definitely give it another chance granted it just opened. And there is nothing like this in SD. \n\nIf ever the chef/owner can try Kazu Nori in LA. I would definitely recommend so they can get some inspiration."
,Owie P.,"One of the best Temaki bars I've been to. The chefs actually talk to you to have a conversation which is always a plus. I mean, that's sorta why you go up to the bar seat, to have a more intimate time between your food and how it's made. My top faves were the negi salmon and the blue crab. V fresh on ya mommas! I can't help it drool while I'm writing this. If you like the poke shop next door, I'm sure you'll love this!"
,Silvia L.,"Its an unique and pleasant dining experience. It definitely is on the pricey side, which is why I am glad I was able to use the BOGO deal they had for their grand opening. The staff were attentive and the chef was able to deliver each hand roll at a good pace. I like the pacing since it gives us time to enjoy and savor the taste in each and every bite. Enjoyable but probably not a place that will fill you up."
,M O.,Nothing special in this restaurant. I am guessing it will remain in soft opening until it eventually closes. Parking situation is terrible in that area to begin with. \n\nI ordered some salmon and hamachi appetizers; they looked like some scrap leftovers when a fish is filleted. Not sure of the taste with that sauce whatever it was.\n\nMenu - not whole lot of choices.  Their \
,jun l.,"Straight out of swanky harajuku!  The space is absolutely stunning.  With the chefs hand rolling each order in the center its a culinary performance that pleases the eyes and appetite.  The edgy murals remind me of the street scenes of young rebels on the Tokyo streets.  As Unapologetically irreverent as Japan generally is apologetically reverent.  The urban vibe combined with the clean lines of this Temaki bar is also reflected in the food.   Leave your past experiences with the typical handroll at the door.   The jwata handroll is wrapped In sumptuous Nori hand warmed on an open flame in front of you.  Yes, hand - warmed - on an open flame !  The Sushi rice is light , fluffy , and delicately seasoned.  The fish is supple, rich , and infused with some kind of essential sauces ?  What can be better ?  The Wagyu beef swish, swished Shabu Shabu style.  What can I say.  Arigato!!"
,Alex V.,"Had to give this place a try since I'm a sucker for handrolls. First impression, the place is kinda small with a U-shaped bar that sits around 20 people. It allows the chefs to interact with their customers which makes the experience much more interesting. The handroll is served 1 at a time directly to your hand to ensure freshness. The rolls are simple yet full of flavor - crispy seaweed wrap, well seasoned rice, good quality fish and a hint of a herb or other flavor depends on the roll.  I got the SAN combo with uni and unagi added.  All of them were really good. My favorite would be the blue crab and uni. They both have a very rich and delicate flavor. I totally recommend this place to anyone who appreciates a delicate yet satisfying Japanese flavor."
,Julie B.,"Came in for their grand opening which they offered a BOGO deal! It was a very unique dining experience. Upon arriving, our waiter sat us and explained how the dining experienced worked.

,Evan G.,"This little concept is fire. Hand rolls, apps and incredible service. Part of the raki raki restaurant family, the food quality is exquisite. I'm not often a yelp reviewer, yet this place has the sauce. I went maine lobby, blue crab, ikura, spanish mackerel app, negi yellowtail, bay scallop, wagyu, and yellowtail sashimi. Double down on the spanish mack. It's the mackD. Ask for it if you're a foodie. It's not on the menu."
,Tania D.,The food was ok ..... super expensive not very satisfying.. I wouldn't go back. One small roll for over $5.. service was good
,Erin K.,"Came in for J Wata's soft opening, and I was delighted by what a unique dining experience it is! I was only used to eating temaki in the cone shape. The chef, James, was really friendly and explained that the round/cylinder shape allows for better distribution of ingredients. The fish was very tender and flavorful, and the hand rolls felt delicately and carefully put together. \n\nIt's pricey for everyday dining, but definitely an experience to see the nori flame-roasted and to taste hand rolls straight from the chefs. I would totally come again for a special occasion or when I want to impress someone with how refined my tastes are."
,Marivic R.,"Hubby and I really enjoyed their hand rolls, especially the bay scallops! We loved it so much we ended up ordering 3 of the Go set menu each consisting of 5 hand rolls!!! The only complaint I have is how they give you a small amount of their premiun soy sauce and a tiny ball of wasabi (see pic). Throughout the meal, I had to ask for 3 refills (which is a hassle) and yet it was not enough. Finding parking in this place is close to impossible, we're lucky enough to find street parking across the street. But they do have this 2 story parking structure across the street by Jasmine restaurant charging only $1 per hour."
,Lora B.,"The concept behind this 24-seat bar are premium handrolls! The menu is small but that is because each handroll is made right in front of you and served personally by the chef. The chef waits until you have finished eating your current roll before making the next one.\nMy husband and I were able to dine in on one of the Grand Opening weekends.  They have been opened for about a month and the word has gotten out.  We came right at 11 am and had no problem getting a seat. When we left 55 minutes later, there was a line.  All of the staff we interacted with were very friendly, made us feel welcome and answered any questions I had.\nOne novelty of this place is that they roast each seaweed on top of a charcoal open flame to get it toasty. You can hear the crunch when you take a bite. I really enjoyed the texture of the nori!\nThey give you a disposable wet towel to wipe your hands with when you sit down. Even though there were chopsticks available, I just used my hands! The usual cone-shaped hand rolls hold everything at the bottom, but these were open ended rolls, so if you are prone to being clumsy like me, you had to be careful because the filling easily came out once you were near the end of the roll. \nWe chose the Go set that came with 5 rolls.  There are no substitutions and no splitting plates.The rolls are about five inches long packed with simple ingredients.We started with the Maine Lobster roll. It was packed with a lot of lobster meat! Delicious! The next roll was the Spicy Tuna roll. It was great, but we're used to eating this sushi so it didn't make that big of an impression. The third roll was a Bay Scallop roll. This was one of my favorites! You can taste the freshness of the seafood and the mayo ratio was just right! The fourth roll was a Negi Salmon roll.   Again, one of our regular sushi rolls. It was also good. The last roll was the Blue Crab roll.  It was heavenly! The sweetness of the crab melted in my mouth! This was very yummy.\nOne might think four or five rolls doesn't make for a filling meal, but when you take the time to savor each one and patiently wait for the next while having good conversation, I was satisfied! This also leaves some room for dessert. The receipt offered a 15% off a same day purchase at the Angels and Hearts creperie next door. Yogurt World and the newly opened Cauldron are a few doors down as well. \nThe atmosphere is like an open exhibition kitchen with interesting art on the walls.  Initially there was only one Chef working while Chef Brian was still prepping. But once the place filled up,  Chef Brian jumped in to start filling the orders. I'm glad too because I wanted some \"
,Janet K.,"Nothing spectacular about this place. My boyfriend and I LOVE sushi so we definitely wanted to check out this restaurant. The price is pretty expensive for what it is. We got a course of 6 maki rolls for almost $30 per course. We only received 5 of the rolls and asked where the 6th one was. The chef swore he gave us all of them but we never received the toro roll. He gave it to us in the end and we definitely have not had it. He confused the salmon roll he gave us for the toro. The fact that he made us feel pretty bad for reminding him totally threw me off. It's a shame because the maki was pretty fresh and delicious. However, I'm definitely not coming back."
,Myungja K.,"It was new dining experience. Never seen anything like this even in Japan! You should go, experience it yourself. Taste? Of course very good. This is a total package!\nMyungja"
,Jenny G.,"Disclaimer: I LOVE handrolls so couldn't wait to try this place. The fish is indeed fresh, and the warmed/toasted nori is a very nice touch. However I felt the value was lacking for what you get. Limiting factors include: a predominately handroll menu so maybe not enough a selection to sustain a business in this area. They also don't do to go orders so you cannot share the goodness with anyone unless they actually come to the joint. The parking is the worst too, so that alone almost makes it not worth coming back to."
,Leslie C.,Happy there's a Hand Roll restaurant in San Diego! This one is definitely worth the try.\n\nFood: I got the \
,Francine P.,"Love this!! FINALLY a warm sushi handroll place in San Diego. This place comes really close to Kazu Nori in Los Angeles. For a soft opening,  the service was great and food on point.  The blue crab and wagyu beef were a hit with the kids. The price was fair for the quality of ingredients. Will definitely return!"
,Greice C.,"So, I was waiting to go to this new place since they opened the restaurant.\nI received an email with a special invitation and then I decided to check it out.\nI got there at 7pm and it was alright to get two seats.\nWe ordered and omg it took forever to start receiving the hand rolls. Our server forgot our water and we needed to keep asking for it . We ran out of soy sauce and we asked her for more, we ended up asking for the couple seating close to us if we could  have some of their soy sauce.\nWe left the restaurant almost 9:30/10pm.\nThe bill was pretty expensive for little hand rolls.\nAnyway I had the discount but guess what?! \nI just realized the same server who was serving us didn't give me the discount.\nI was so upset that I didn't wanna come back there.\nIn a nutshell I won't come back there.\nI hope you all have better experience than me."
,Morley J.,"We spent $50+ at this place and left so hungry we had to find another spot in Convoy to eat at.  The food is decent - fish quality is similar to what you'd find at Poke bowl places (sashimi is not cut on the spot, but stored in Tupperware containers Subway style).  The idea of being served handmade temaki rolls from a chef at a bar is a pretty cool experience,  but then again you have to wait for the chef to cook one hand roll at a time for everyone seated at the bar - not a good idea when you're hungry! Overall the portions are too small and the quality is mediocre at best.  Maybe a good appetizer spot but not if you're looking for a good meal at a good price!"
,Shingo H.,Went because the Kazunori in la is pretty dope. Same concept but falls short. Service was much slower than expected with subpar fish.
,ka a.,"First time at J Wata and it was delicious! The hamachi sashimi had a nice clean refreshing finish to it, and the hand rolls were perfect balance of rice to fish and so good! The chef kept a nice pace as he carefully prepared the next roll after I was done with each roll, to ensure quality and integrity of the roll. Can't wait to go back on my next SD visit!"
,Jordan T.,"Of my two visits J Wata has quickly become my favorite Japanese restaurant in San Diego. When first entering you are immediately drawn to the hip murals wrapped around the walls. The menu is very simple and to the point. You can either order individual rolls or get a pre set option. I have tried the spicy salmon, unagi, spicy toro, Maine lobster, negi yellowtail, blue crab, and the negi salmon. All of them were amazing with the unagi and spicy salmon being my favorites. The unagi has a perfect amount of bbq flavor without it being an overkill. I loved the creamy texture of the spicy toro and how well the rice complements the fish. Service is awesome, they definitely aim to make everyone have a personalized experience. The chef James is very knowledgeable about the menu as well as being great to talk to! The quality and the experience you get doesn't compare to anywhere else in San Diego."
,Karina D.,"Amazing hand rolls only second to their exceptional customer service. I went on a weekday at 11:45am trying to beat the lunch rush and was surprised to find the place semi empty. If you're near the Convoy area, do not skip out on this new hand-roll bar. We were well attended and the sushi chef worked his magic to make sure each roll was delivered timely. Would absolutely recommend and can't wait to come back."
,Maureen C.,"Great service, cool place and the food was good but the rolls are small.  Not a 5 star because of the size, these are more like appy size. \nI did enjoy the food but I will stick with the cone hand rolls as you get twice as much for the same price."
,NBoogie V.,This is quite the experience. It tastes delicious and it's such a nice change from all the sushi places that make crazy rolls with sub par ingredients. The hand rolls are simple yet so delicious. I would come here every day if my wallet allowed. \n\nThis place is going to get busy once people start hearing about it so go now and get it while you can. Hopefully it doesn't go down in quality once it gains popularity. And I swear if you complain about slow service maybe you shouldn't come here. The serving of the rolls is very personalized and the serving is spaced out so you can enjoy your food. \n\nRight now they really seem to care about honing their craft and making sure everything is perfect.
,Christina V.,"I wanted to thank Chef Brian for the great service and made our dining experience as wonderful as it could be. Server Vincent with the great smile and didn't stop me from my #sundayfunday drinking. The host, I never got your name but I know you tried your best to help me understand the concept of the restaurant. That being said, we also went for the #grandopening event BOGOF #stealdeal. Of course, we went for the baller status and got the GO set. We really enjoyed the Maine \u0026 Blue Crab Temaki. They are served with a house creamy sauce. Best Spicy Tuna I ever had and it wasn't that crazy neon red color. Here is couple #freetips: Pass on the Wagyu Shabu. It was tender but bland. End your Temaki experience with Unagi. They boil it and torch it up and it is a just prefect way to end your meal. Try the white wine. Want to know a secret menu item? If you come an hour before they close, ask for the Brian's special. They can serve you the Shabu broth that has been simmering all day with Wagyu Beef. #extraprotein. You are welcome, friends. :)"
,Kendra L.,Delicious!!! Definitely our new go to date spot! The servers were friendly and attentive and everything was fresh!
,Jeff U.,"If you are looking for Japanese food, this is not the place for you.  While the food was good, it was pre-prepared seafood, meaning the seafood contents are premixed with a tasty sauce.  Not traditional by any means.  if looking for sushi, go elsewhere.  The place seemed clean and nice.  we had the spicy salmon, blue crab and lobster hand rolls.  We were expecting something freshly prepared.  They were all pre-mixed fillings."
,Connie T.,My girlfriend and I came here at lunch time around 11:30AM and it wasn't very busy which we were happy about. We had the GO combo and wagyu and it was pretty tasty. We both agreed that it was awkward AF every time one of the chefs would walk up to us and hand us a handroll. Why isn't there a small plate on the bar where the chef could place the handroll when its ready? Instead we had to do this awkward exchange with the chef/stranger 5-6 times to eat.
,Jay X.,"I timed two recent visits for a time between lunchtime and dinner to avoid crowds and it paid off, immediate seating excellent service. The food was awesome, could taste the freshness of the various fish and seafood. The hot green tea is excellent as well. The staff are professional and skilled.  The cool decor and music add to the experience."
,Jake L.,"Very glad there is a place like this in San Diego, no more relying on LA trips to get Kazunori. If only the parking situation was a bit better in this area, it'd be a slam dunk. Handrolls were great, and service was even better!\n\nLooking forward to coming back."
,Angela L.,"If I had to describe my dining experience in three words: artistic, fresh, and addictive. \n\nArtistic: You're seated at the bar overlooking the masterful chefs as they prepare each roll to order. Their craft and dedication to quality work are mesmerizing- the way they wave the nori over an open flame, the way they shape the freshly cooked rice, the way they cook the indulgently fatty wagyu shabu meat, I could go on. You've got a front row seat to watch this beautiful dance.\n\nFresh: There's never been a more appropriate place to eat with your hands. You select your meal set (ranging from 3-5 rolls each), then the chef prepares each roll by hand before you. Your chef hands you the rolls and they encourage you to receive each roll by hand (instead of letting them place it on your plate), this way you can immediately begin eating it. From the start, they emphasized the urgency of eating the rolls immediately in order to preserve the integrity for the ingredients. Each roll uses super high quality ingredients- the fish is light and pure, the rice is warm and flavorful, and the nori is toasty and crisp. If you're anything like me, I've been taught to always wait for everyone to receive their food before eating, so it was a bit weird to start eating before my friends got their rolls, but again, you have to eat the rolls while they're fresh. And no worries, the chef keeps a watchful eye in order to control the pacing of your meal. They're mindful to provide you with some time between rolls to savor each one, that way you're never overwhelmed or rushed, while also ensuring you're never waiting too long for your next roll. \n\nAddictive: Oh man, my friends and I joked about inquiring how much it'd cost to rent out a seat at the bar and set up permanent residence. But honestly, even before our meal set was over, we were bummed that our dining experience was coming to an end. We're definitely going to be returning soon.\n\nThe only con would be parking. It's located in the same plaza as RakiRaki and Pokkirito (same owners); parking has always been challenging in this plaza, but I'm sure with the success of this restaurant, parking will be nearly impossible. Good luck, it's worth the wait."
,Nazanin N.,I went for dinner with my husband and 2 other friends. The place is small and they make your order one at a time. You sit around the bar next to other people and they are standing in the middle making everyone's order. It's pretty interesting and fun. It is an actual Temaki Bar no other sits or tables. Which makes it unique
,Ed R.,"The rice and nori are good and the waitress was cute and friendly. Those are the only good points.\n\nThe hamachi hand-roll was mild, the toro was totally flavorless, the spicy salmon was not spicy but at least was decently fresh, and the blue crab was alright. But all of them were really tiny. The price seems cheap but it's really not when you factor in how extremely tiny the amount of fish in each roll is, as well as how mediocre it all was.\n\nEven the hot tea was served in a cup that burned my hand if held for more than a second. And it just tasted like hot water, not tea."
,Melissa L.,"Best hand rolls I've ever had! Such incredibly nice staff and wonderful food, highly recommend."
,Tawny B.,J Wata Temaki Bar is an experience of its own. It brings the intimate experience of Japanese culture cuisine to Convoy. It definitely isn't a place to go if you plan to stuff yourself but the food is definitely quality. My favorite hand rolls were the scallops and yellowtail. In addition to those I also order the wagyu which was delicious as well. Would definitely recommend this place!!
,salvador p.,"I rarely give 5 stars but this place deserves it. Simple menu, good service, incredibly fresh and  great tasting  hand rolls. The chef hands the freshly made rolls to be eaten immediately. The toasted nori adds perfect texture. Good value for the money. If there is a downside, it is the availability of parking."
,Renee M.,Brand new Restaurant. They are all about the hand roll. Nori is like no other I have tasted and they give you one roll at a time. They want you to experience each roll as it is crispy and fresh and not soggy. The chefs are very nice and the owner came by to talk to us. He owns Raki Raki and Pokerito and is very personable and friendly. He seems to care about producing a quality product. Tried the Ikura (Salmon Roe) and was one of the freshest I have ever had. I actually judge my opinion of the Restaurant with the quality of their Ikura. My husband loved it and he is not normally a fan. Great place to try. We will return.
,Vivian C.,"YES. Finally a hand roll sushi concept in San Diego. This place is amazing. There was no wait during the soft opening, but I'd expect crowds to flock here as people learn about this place. The negi toro and spicy salmon are my favorite."
,Shigeo H.,Dinning innovation! You have to be there to sense it and taste it. You will like it for sure. guaranteed! Enjoy your Temaki!\nA sushi lover
,Skull C.,Tasty but expensive for what it is. This place is basically sugar fish from Los Angeles but mostly focused on hand rolls. While tasty the prices are kind of not worth it for the food you get. We spent $50 and felt like we wanted a ramen next door. Still I might go back if I wanted a light fresh meal.
,Ana C.,"This is probably one of my new favorite spots in Convoy. No other place can touch their customer service. Plus, they have cute modern decor which makes you feel really comfortable."
,Jake T.,"Fantastic experience here. Delightfully Unique. Good date spot or if you're just looking for something trendy and new. Lobster Temaki was my favorite, but everything was good."
,Justin Y.,Stumbled into this place while waiting for Ramen next door. Opened by the same chef as Rakiraki. The hand rolls were divine. The blue crab roll was our favorite. The service was exceptional and the sushi chefs were very personable.
,Joseph S.,"Crispy hand rolls.  Cool combos, although I went for a la carts to have the wagyu and other specialty items. Did I mention crispy hand rolls."
,John W.,So glad to have such a quality venue in the neighborhood! Being in the industry myself I tend to have high expectations. But this is the first time in a long while that the experience went way above any experience I've had while dining out. Service was amazing and the rolls were some the best I've had! There's no doubt I'll be returning constantly! I highly recommend anyone to do the same!
