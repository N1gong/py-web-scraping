Getting the data on 10 K filings in a dataframe 

In this part of the assignment you are provided a list of mutual funds and the companies that were dropped from their portfolios.  We want to obtain the 10-K filings for these companies.  In the file (Dropped_Companies.csv), there is a column called "Name of Stock".  Load the file, extract a list of all the companies in that column, then find the 10-K links for all these companies.  Feel free to utilize Beautiful Soup and Pandas.
